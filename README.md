# SEAM-AI-GPU-Hackathon
This repository contains the Rocky-AI teams first place Test 1 and third place Test 2 solution to the Parihaka Seismic Facies Identification Challenge in the SEAM/NVIDIA Applied Geoscience GPU Hackathon. The goal was a six-way classification of the Parihaka 3D seismic survey, with emphasis on interface and key facies. We implemented the U-Net architecture of the EfficientNet-B0 prretarined network using Python with Pytorch, and achieved 98% training accuracy and 95% test accuracy on internal validation. ![Rocky-AI Test 1 ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59252183/117088564-be7d4d00-ad4a-11eb-961c-1b9fcff38dbe.png)
